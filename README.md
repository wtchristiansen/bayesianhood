Stock Price Prediction Script README

Overview

This script is designed to predict stock prices using historical stock data and incorporating macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth rate and inflation. It utilizes the Bayesian modeling approach with the brms package in R, allowing for a comprehensive analysis that includes uncertainty quantification through credible intervals. The model also considers non-linear trends and autocorrelation in the stock prices over time.

Dependencies

The script requires the following R packages:

quantmod: For fetching historical stock data.
tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization.
brms: For Bayesian modeling.
caret: For data splitting (training and testing).
future and doFuture: For parallel processing.
ggplot2: For data visualization.
extrafont: For additional font options in plots.
mgcv: For modeling non-linear trends using splines.
WDI: For accessing World Bank's World Development Indicators.
Ensure all packages are installed and up to date before running the script.

Data Sources
Stock data is fetched using the quantmod package, which pulls data from Yahoo Finance.
Economic indicators are fetched using the WDI package, accessing the World Bank's World Development Indicators database.
Script Workflow
Setup: Load necessary libraries and set up parallel processing.
Data Fetching: Retrieve historical stock data for a specified symbol and macroeconomic indicators.
Data Preparation: Merge stock data with economic indicators, handle missing values, and prepare variables for modeling.
Modeling:
Define a Bayesian model formula incorporating time index, economic indicators, and non-linear trends.
Fit the model using the brms package.
Generate posterior predictions and credible intervals.
Visualization:
Visualize historical fit and future predictions with credible intervals.
Apply a custom theme for visualization inspired by The Economist.
Running the Script
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Update the symbol, start_date, and end_date variables to fetch stock data for your stock of interest and the desired time frame.
Update the country code in the WDI fetch section if you're interested in economic indicators from a country other than the US.
Run the script in RStudio or any R environment.
Customization
The model formula can be adjusted to include or exclude variables based on data availability and relevance.
The visualization section can be customized to match personal or presentation preferences.
Limitations and Considerations
The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and relevance of the data used. Stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, and not all may be captured in this model.
The script assumes a simplistic approach to handling missing data, which might not be suitable for all cases. Further data preprocessing may be required for optimal model performance.
The economic indicators used in the model are global averages and may not perfectly reflect the economic conditions relevant to all stocks or sectors.
